        What is kitfo?
        A culinary specialty of the Gurage region of Central Ethiopia, kitfo is a rich and flavorful dish made with
        minced raw lean beef, spices (the classic Ethiopian spice blend known as mitmita), and an herb-infused clarified
        butter known as niter kibbeh. Kitfo is renowned for its bold flavor and luxurious texture.

    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds lean beef, such as boneless knuckle or top round</li>
        <li>1/2 cup kibbeh (seasoned clarified butter) or ghee</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mitmita (Ethiopian spiced chile blend)</li>
        <li>
            1/2 teaspoon ground korerima (black cardamom)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon koseret powder (earthy, woodsy dried Ethiopian herb)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon fine salt</li>


    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the beef into thin slices, trim any fat and then mince into very small cubes, preferably by hand, or in
            a food processor. Set the beef aside, spreading it over a plate.</li>
        <li>Melt the kibbeh in a medium skillet over very low heat. Add the mitmita, korerima, koseret and salt and stir
            with the butter. Then, add the minced beef and mash to mix it with the spiced butter; keep mixing until the
            beef reaches your desired temperature, 3 to 5 minutes for rare.</li>
    </ol>
